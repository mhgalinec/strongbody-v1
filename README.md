## Description
  - My first attempt at creating a web application but as this is not the intended way to make apps nowadays I have decided to recreate it with modern technologies
  - For more details about the application visit the <i>[strongbody](https://github.com/mhgalinec/strongbody-v2)</i> repository where the upgraded version is (they have basically the same functionality with some differences)
  - This version has a .txt file that is created every 24 hours (if the app is used daily) and logs on a debug level
  
## Technologies
  - JDK 11
  - Tomcat 9.0
  - MySQL Database
  - Servlet 4.0
  - JSP 2.3
  - log4j2
